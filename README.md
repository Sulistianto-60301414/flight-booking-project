# Flight Booking (Java)

I built this small console app to practice OOP and collections. It lets me:
- list available flights
- book a seat (auto‑assign)
- cancel a booking
- check flight status
- add a new flight and view customer details

## How I run it
In the project folder (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
javac -d out *.java
java -cp out Main
```

Then just follow the menu (type a number). Press `0` to exit.

Requirements: Java 17+ (I’ve also used Java 23).
